# 🧠 BrainFusion: Multi-Modal Alzheimer's Detection

### 🚀 Overview
**BrainFusion** is a Hybrid Deep Learning project designed to detect Alzheimer's Disease stages by combining **Computer Vision** with **Clinical Metadata**. 

Most traditional models rely solely on MRI scans. This project implements a **Dual-Input Neural Network** that fuses spatial features from MRI images (CNN branch) with patient clinical stats like MMSE and Age (MLP branch) to achieve a more holistic diagnosis.

### 📊 Key Results
* **Accuracy:** 84% 
* **F1-Score (Healthy):** 0.93
* **Early Stage Recall:** 0.80 (Mild Demented)

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras 3
* **Architecture:** Hybrid CNN + MLP (Multi-Input)
* **Processing:** OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Pandas
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 📖 How it Works
1. **CNN Branch:** Extracts structural atrophy patterns from $128 \times 128$ MRI slices.
2. **Tabular Branch:** Normalizes clinical metrics (Age, MMSE, Brain Volume) for context.
3. **Fusion:** Concatenates both feature vectors into a final classification head.
